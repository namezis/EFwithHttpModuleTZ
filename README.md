EFwithHttpModuleTZ
==================

Complete example on how to use Entity Framework with Web applications. This solution is using http module to create and dispose of EF context, so there is no need to bother with EF context management code within website code.

I have assembled this code on the base of samples from book: ASP.NET 4.0 in practice. The book did not have the exact sample included, but for modest size web site the configuration looks pretty neat.

This solution does not include separate assembly for business logic.
